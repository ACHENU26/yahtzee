## Yahtzee Rules
The objective of YAHTZEE is to get as many points as possible by rolling five dice and getting certain combinations of dice.

Each player rolls five six-sided dice. They can re-roll some or all of them up to 3 times (including the original roll).

## Tasks 
Our objective in this repository is to carry out a multitude of tests on dice game. We carry out the tests in TDD with the Python language.
