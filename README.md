# YAHTZEE
## Yahtzee Rules
The objective of YAHTZEE is to get as many points as possible by rolling five dice and getting certain combinations of dice.

Each player rolls five six-sided dice. They can re-roll some or all of them up to 3 times (including the original roll).
### Combinaisons 
#### Upper section combinaisons 
- **Ones:** Get as many ones as possible.
- **Two:** Get as many twos as possible.
- **Three:** Get as many threes as possible.
- **Four:** Get as many fours as possible.
- **Five:** Get as many fives as possible.
- **Sixe:** Get as many sixes as possible.
#### Lower section combinations
- **Chance:** You can put anything into chance, it's basically like a garbage can when you don't have anything else you can use the dice for. The score is simply the sum of the dice.
- **YAHTZEE:** Five of a kind. Scores 50 points. You can optionally get multiple Yahtzees, see below for details.
- **Full house:** Get three of a kind and a pair, e.g. 1,1,3,3,3 or 3,3,3,6,6. Scores 25 points.
- **Three of a kind:** Get three dice with the same number. Points are the sum all dice (not just the three of a kind).
- **Four of a kind:** Get four dice with the same number. Points are the sum all dice (not just the four of a kind).
- **Small straight:** Get four sequential dice, 1,2,3,4 or 2,3,4,5 or 3,4,5,6. Scores 30 points.
- **Large straight:** Get five sequential dice, 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6. Scores 40 points.
